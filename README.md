This program gets status from the BCS API, writes it to an InfluxDB database (for external
visualization (e.g., Grafana) and data-logging purposes), and live-tweets brew session info.  ***CAUTION*** This is a work in-progress; some functionality may not be in place yet. Questions/comments are welcome - just message me!
